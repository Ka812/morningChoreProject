# morningChoreProject
Young schoolboy or schoolgirl may use this if parents are not home

I had to do some project in Java Code -curse, and I thaught what to do. I remembered my son, who had to do his morning chores without parents' help, because we were doing our jobs. So, we made a list to the paper, that he could make it. So, now I thaught that I could do it like this. I'm still just learning this Code systems, in the beginning, so, this is about what I can do right now. But I want to learn more! :)

If you want to test this, it is quite easy. When you start it, you must choose first, do you prefer use finnish or english (you must choose 1 or 2).
Then app ask time and also time, when schoolday is starting and are you going to go to school by walking or by bysicle (I hope that not by bus :) )
After that it comments something and start to give chores to do, and when you have done some chore, you must tell, how long did it take (remember press enter -button after telling it).
You'll get information after every chore, that how much have you time before leaving to school. 
After you have done all your chores you will get a comment, that how much time you have before going to school and how have you made your chores.
